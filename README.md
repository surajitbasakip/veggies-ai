# VeggiesAI: A Flutter Concept App

A 5-screen Flutter app I *designed* to help newbies grow veggies—picks locations, fetches weather, and suggests setups. Built in 1 week as my first Flutter experiment!

## What It Does
- **Flow**: Location Selection → Planting Styles → Weather Fetch → Veggie Suggestions → Growing Guide.
- **Tech**: Flutter, Dart, Geolocator (location), HTTP (OpenWeatherMap API), custom UI (gradients, cards).

## My Role
- Dreamed up the idea and user flow.
- Defined the UI: gradients, shadows, back arrows, punchy text.
- Used AI (Grok, by xAI) to code it—I’m the architect, Grok’s the builder.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veggies-ai.git`
2. Install Flutter: [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)
3. Run `flutter pub get` to grab dependencies.
4. Replace the OpenWeatherMap API key in `main.dart` (line ~300) with your own: [Get one here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
5. `flutter run` on an emulator/simulator.

## Status
Proof-of-concept—my jump from computational physics (PhD) to mobile dev!
